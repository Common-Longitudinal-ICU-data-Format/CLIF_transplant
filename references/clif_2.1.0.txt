The CLIF Data Dictionary serves as a comprehensive guide to the Common Longitudinal ICU data Format, detailing the structure and purpose of each table within the framework. Designed to standardize and harmonize electronic health record data across multiple institutions, the dictionary outlines the entity-relationship model, variable definitions, and permissible values.

![ERD](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/images/ERD-2.1.0.png)

# **Beta tables**

The table purpose, structure, and field names for beta tables is complete and used in at least one federated CLIF project. The [minimum Common ICU Data Elements (mCIDE)](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/mCIDE.html) for category variables is defined. Actively testing the table’s practical use in projects. Breaking changes unlikely, but backward compatible updates in future minor versions possible

## ADT [Anchor](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-2.1.0.html\#adt)

The admission, discharge, and transfer (ADT) table is a start-stop longitudinal dataset that contains information about each patient’s movement within the hospital. It also has a `hospital_id` field to distinguish between different hospitals within a health system.

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Beta-yellow.png)](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/maturity.html)

| hospitalization\_id | VARCHAR | ID variable for each patient encounter | No restriction |  |
| hospital\_id | VARCHAR | Assign a unique ID to each hospital within a healthsystem | No restriction |  |
| hospital\_type | VARCHAR | Maps `hospital_id` to a standardized list of hospital types | `academic`, `community` |  |
| in\_dttm | DATETIME | Start date and time at a particular location. All datetime variables must be timezone-aware and set to UTC. | Datetime format should be `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+00:00` (UTC) |  |
| out\_dttm | DATETIME | End date and time at a particular location. All datetime variables must be timezone-aware and set to UTC. | Datetime format should be `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+00:00` (UTC) |  |
| location\_name | VARCHAR | Location of the patient inside the hospital. This field is used to store the patient location from the source data. It is not used for analysis. | No restriction |  |
| location\_category | VARCHAR | Maps `location_name` to a standardized list of ADT location categories | `ed`, `ward`, `stepdown`, `icu`, `procedural`, `l&d`, `hospice`, `psych`, `rehab`, `radiology`, `dialysis`, `other` |  |

**Notes**:

- ADT represents the patient’s physical location, NOT the patient “status”.
- Procedural areas and operating rooms should be mapped to `Procedural`. Pre/Intra/Post-procedural/OR EHR data (such as anesthesia flowsheet records from Labs, Vitals, Scores, Respiratory Support) **are not currently** represented in CLIF.

## Hospitalization [Anchor](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-2.1.0.html\#hospitalization)

The hospitalization table contains information about each hospitalization event. Each row in this table represents a unique hospitalization event for a patient. This table is inspired by the [visit\_occurance](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#visit_occurrence) OMOP table but is specific to inpatient hospitalizations (including those that begin in the emergency room).

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Beta-yellow.png)](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/maturity.html)

| patient\_id | VARCHAR | Unique identifier for each patient, linking to the `patient` table | No restriction |
| hospitalization\_id | VARCHAR | Unique identifier for each hospitalization encounter. Each hospitalization\_id represents a unique stay in the hospital | No restriction |
| hospitalization\_joined\_id | VARCHAR | Unique identifier for each continuous inpatient stay in a health system which may span different hospitals (Optional) | No restriction |
| admission\_dttm | DATETIME | Date and time the patient is admitted to the hospital. All datetime variables must be timezone-aware and set to UTC. | Datetime format should be `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+00:00`(UTC) |

| state\_code | VARCHAR | 2 digit FIPS code | No restriction |
| county\_code | VARCHAR | 5 digit FIPS code | No restriction |

**Notes**:

1. If a patient is discharged to Home/Hospice, then `discharge_category == Hospice`.

2. The geographical indicators( `zipcode_nine_digit`, `zipcode_five_digit`, `census_block_code`, `census_block_group_code`, `census_tract`, `state_code`, `county_code`) should be added if they are available in your source dataset. `zipcode_nine_digit` is preferred over `zipcode_five_digit`, and `census_block_code` is ideal for census based indicators.The choice of geographical indicators may differ depending on the project.

3. If a patient is transferred between different hospitals within a health system, a new `hospitalization_id` should be created

4. If a patient is initially seen in an ER in hospital A and then admitted to inpatient status in hospital B, one `hospitalization_id` should be created for data from both stays

5. A `hospitalization_joined_id` can also be created from a CLIF table from contiguous `hospitalization_ids`

The medication admin continuous table is a long-form (one medication administration record per) longitudinal table designed for continuous infusions of common ICU medications such as vasopressors and sedation (Boluses of these drugs should be recorded in `med_admin_intermittent`). Note that it only reflects dose changes of the continuous medication and does not have a specific “end\_time” variable to indicate the medication being stopped.

# **Future proposed tables**

These are tables without any defined structure that the consortium has not yet committed to implementing.

- **Clinical Decision Support**: This table will capture the actions of clinical decision support tools embedded in the EHR. The table will have the following fields: `cds_name`, `cds_category`, `cds_value`, `cds_trigger_ddtm`.
